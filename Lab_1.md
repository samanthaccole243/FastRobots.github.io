## Lab 1

This lab Was relatively simple. We were asked to download the latest arduino IDE and install the SparkFun Apollo3 Boards. As you can see below I did this. This is also evident by the fact that I was able to choose the correct board to upload to (RedBoard Artemis Nano) as seen in the other photo below.
