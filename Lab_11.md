## Lab 11

For this lab we are given an updated code from lab 10 to go off of. This is within the file lab11_sim.ipynb.
Below is the plot this code creates after running the bayes filter code with a prediction step and an update step.

We are also given two additional files: (1) a fully functional localization module that works on the virtual robot and (2) a jupyter notebook with a the skeleton code to implement bayes filter on the physical robot in conjunction with the localization.
