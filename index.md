## Samantha Cole's ECE 5160 Fast Robots page

Hello! Welcome to my page.

## Introduction
 I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering Masters student at Cornell University graduating in May 2023. I also graduated from Cornell University with an undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a minor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I spend my free time taking care of my dog *cough cough* baby Pippy (pictured below).
